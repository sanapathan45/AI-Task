# Python program to illustrate the different set operations:

# sets
S = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

# set union
print("Union of S and A is",S | A)

# set intersection
print("Intersection of S and A is",S & A)

# set difference
print("Difference of S and A is",S - A)

# set symmetric difference
print("Symmetric difference of S and A is",S ^ A)
